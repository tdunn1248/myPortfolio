          <p>As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
            I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
            â€˜Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
            That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
            But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
            Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
            You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
            Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
            I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
            As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
            Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
            On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light</p>
